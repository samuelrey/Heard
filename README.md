musical notation. The purpose of this software is to study the qualities of
music. This work has applications in identifying the measurable attributes of
music for both the musician and developer. Written in Python 2.7.

The main branch of this project can be found on GitHub (github.com/samuelrey

files of differing bit depth and number of channels, as well as locate notes in
the file and perform frequency analyses.

Tests will be continuously added as will features such as a supervised learning
algorithm to increase the robustness of the note detection methods.
